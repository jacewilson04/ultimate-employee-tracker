# Ultimate Employee Tracker

## Description
This app has the functionality of managing employees and their positions at a business enviorment. The app supports Departments, Roles, Employees, and Salaries. It is primary interacted with through a command line prompt. Two features that I added that I am very happy with are the text that shows if your request succeded or failed and the return home feature. I added the sucess print to easilly show the user how things went right and if they went wrong where they went wrong so the client can fix it on their end. I also added return home feature so the user can focus mainly on the primary displayed text content instead of being overloaded with excess information.

## How to Use
First initialize MySql by sourcing the schema and the seeds. Next simply run the index.js script and everything will work!! Yayyy!!
